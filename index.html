        <h1 class="section-title"><span>Why</span> you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing company.</h1>
        <p>One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify who will be interested in your
          property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with <span>Luxury Presence</span>, you benefit from the many
          different types of marketing capabilities the company offers. Here is how:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service-bottom">
        <div class="service-item1">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="https://img.icons8.com/external-creatype-two-colour-colourcreatype/64/EEEEEE/external-advertising-marketing-digital-creatype-two-colour-colourcreatype-6.png" />
          </div>
          <h2>Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
          <p>To reach your potential buyers, <span>you have to know who they are</span>, where they spend their time online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to identify your
            niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to
            those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item2">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/EEEEEE/content.png" />
          </div>
          <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
          <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real
            estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey, <span>85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video</span>—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with
            potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult
            to do with a written description.
            <br>
          <p>However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with
            Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.</p>
          </p>

        <div class="service-item3">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="https://img.icons8.com/dotty/80/EEEEEE/search-bar.png" />
          </div>
          <h2>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
          <p>Recent research has shown that <span>44% of buyers found the home they purchased</span> on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show
            up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly
            using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities for the
            buyer to learn more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item4">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="https://img.icons8.com/wired/64/EEEEEE/share-2.png" />
          </div>
          <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
          <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to
            social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social
            media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they
            can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.</p>
